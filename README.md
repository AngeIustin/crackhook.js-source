OTC v3 javascript

This is a clean source of my javascript made for the cracked version of onetap.com (OTC v3). This source has many features useful for semiraging / blatant cheating with OTC v3 . All features has been seperated and formatted carefully for people looking for reference or pasting materials. The original code can be found in semirage.js. Changes from the original script:
- R8 revolver fakelag fix (now it does not randomly shoot with fake lag on)
- Autostrafe improve with customizable turn speed
- Vote revealer ( see what the enemies are voting like kicking a teammate or surrender)
- Override minimum damage on key
- Custom clantag presets (updated)
- Better slow-walk
- FPS boost
- Show enemy loadout (special thanks and huge respect to LeoDeveloper and Monotonized#6495)
- Dump MM wins + rank
